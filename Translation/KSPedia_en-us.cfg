#LOC_FUR.kspedia.12 = A product from Kerbetrotter Ltd.

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.13 = Feline Utility Rovers adds parts you can use to build rovers to drive around.
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.14 = It comes with everything you need for a fully functional mobile base, including a comfy crew cabin and a mobile laboratory. 
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.15 = It also includes hitches and joints for higher flexibility!

//---Hitches Page---

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.01 = Hitches and Joints
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.02 = Hitches and Joints allow you to create articulated vehicles. You can right-click on these parts to unlock them. They can also be locked again when they are in their original orientation.

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.03 = Hitches
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.04 = Hitches allow you to dock and undock your articulated vehicle. Due to some restrictions, the docking port and the active hitch cannot be the same part and are therefore separated. To create a functional hitch you have to attach the parts in the following arrangement:

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.05 = Hitch Docking Adapter
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.06 = Hitch(Active)
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.07 = Hitch(passive)

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.08 = Pivoting joint with bellow
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.09 = The pivoting joint with bellow allows kerbals to go through, like in an articulated bus. They have to be attached to the Joint Adapter on each side to work reliably.

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.10 = Important!
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.11 = Never attach the detaching site of a separatpor or docking port directly to any hitch or joint! They will eventually cease to function when separating.
