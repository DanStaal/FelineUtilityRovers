//---Hitches Page---

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.01 = Hitches and Joints

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.03 = Hitches
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.04 = Hitches allow you to dock and undock your articulated vehicle. Due to some restrictions, the docking port and the active hitch cannot be the same part and are therefore separated. To create a functional hitch you have to attach the parts in the following arrangement:

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.05 = Hitch Docking Adapter
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.06 = Hitch(Active)
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.07 = Hitch(passive)

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.08 = Joint with folding bellow
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.09 = The joint with folding bellow allows Kerbals to go through, like in an articulated bus. They have to be attached to the Joint Adapter on each side to work reliably.

#LOC_FUR.kspedia.10 = Important!
#LOC_FUR.kspedia.11 = Never attach the detaching site of a separator or docking port directly to any hitch or joint! They will eventually cease to function when separating.
