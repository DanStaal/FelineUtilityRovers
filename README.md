Kerbetrotter Ltd. is happy to announce its newest creation from the Feline Utility Rover series: The Lynx Rover.  
A medium sized versatile rover that is capable to operate independently in the harshest environments. It is mainly  
designed to operate on other planets, but also in the outback of Kerbin. Depending on your configuration it can  
contain crew cabins, a laboratory or even bellowed joints to be more flexible in difficult terrain.

## Looking for help:
If anyone is interested to translate FUR into Russian ![](http://i.imgur.com/mFRcn0a.png) ([in process](https://github.com/Tirathangil/FelineUtilityRovers/tree/master/Translation)), Japanese ![](http://i.imgur.com/M93S44Z.png), Chinese ![](http://i.imgur.com/JyqfJ1P.png)   
(or the other languages that will be supported), please let me know!  

Important: Please contact me before you start with the translation. It already happend more than once that  
multiple persons worked on a translation for the same texts and therefore their efforts were in vain.  

You can find all the texts that need translation here: [Texts](https://github.com/Nils277/FelineUtilityRovers/tree/master/Translation). (1968 Words)

Also thanks to [Snjo](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57198-snjo/) for the Firespitter mod. The Fuel switch is based on the one from Firespitter.
