Kerbetrotter Ltd. is happy to announce its newest creation from the Feline Utility Rover series: The Lynx Rover.  
A medium sized versatile rover that is capable to operate independently in the harshest environments. It is mainly  
designed to operate on other planets, but also in the outback of Kerbin. Depending on your configuration it can  
contain crew cabins, a laboratory or even bellowed joints to be more flexible in difficult terrain.

**sirkut** and **Ziw** for Infernal Robotics, which was used as reference/learning source for the functionality of the hitch.  
Also thanks to **Snjo** for the Firespitter mod. The Fuel switch is based on the one from Firespitter.
